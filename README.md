**[Crossviewer]** 

A simple app that works in the following ways:

- Loads a single image
- Makes a duplicate of it
- offsets both by a tilt of 0.7 and -0.7
  This causes the brain to fallback and calculate depth based on object-size, not difference fields

I have added a color slider so that the user can utilize retinal rivalry to see spectrums that do not exist.
